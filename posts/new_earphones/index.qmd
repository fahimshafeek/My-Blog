# The HUAWEI Freebuds SE 2

Its been one very happy and content month's experience with this new set of TWS earphones from Huawei. 

The product is overall well build and optimised to work with most devices. The connections are instant and seamless. The buds are really comfortable to wear for long sessions. The sound is clear, with some real punchy bass and well balanced high ends. The battery life is very impressive, with 9hrs a pop for each of the buds, with the case providing upto 40hrs of playback time. The buds also come with mic audio noise cancellation, although the mic could do with a bit of an improvement. The colours are really nice and neutral, with mine, the blue one, being the one with the most flair. The fit is comfortable and breathable. The case also comes with USB-C charging and provides 2hrs of playback with just 10mins of charging which can come in handy for those days when you forget to charge your earphones, because lets face it, secondary wearables are at the bottom of all of ours priority lists when it comes to charging stuff.

## Improvements and Nice-To-Haves

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) would be really great to have. The case is plastic and has a really glossy finish, which makes it a fingerprint magnet and Ive also got countless faint scratches and scuffs on it too. The mic is downright disappointing, the audio quality is really muffled whether the environment is noisey or not.
